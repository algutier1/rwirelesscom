Description: A basic communications simulation package supporting common wireless modulations formats
    including BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-PSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM. The package includes
    AWGN noise generation, and raised cosine and square root raised cosine
    pulse shaping. It also includes convenience functions for plotting
    constellation diagrams, density plots, stem plots and eye diagrams. Together these functions
    enable the evaluation of bit error and symbol error rates, evalutation pulse shaping and inter-symbol
    interferance and support visualization of the respective signals and noise in a variety of formats.
