fqpskdemod(r)

\arguments{
\item{r:}{received signal plus noise.}
}
\description{
Receives a vector of complex values, corresponding to a
BPSK modulated signal transmitted through a communications channel
(e.g., signal plus noise). The received signal, r, is mapped to its in-phase (real part) and
quadrature parts (imaginary part). If the in phase part is > 0 then the corresponding bit value output is 1,
otherwise 0. Similarly, if the quadrature part (imaginary) > 0 then the corresponding bit value
is 1, otherwise 0.
